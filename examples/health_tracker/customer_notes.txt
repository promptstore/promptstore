The customer has had previous issues with mental health. Stress has had a significant impact on their health over the past year.

The customer works long hours and finds it difficult to settle into sleep.

The customer meets the criteria for "metabolic syndrome" - raised blood pressure, increased abdominal fat, disturbed lipids (cholesterol), and liver inflammation (shown through elevated liver enzymes).

The customer needs to improve their aerobic fitness, with increased strength in second place.

I’d recommend 2 sessions per week, mainly longer workouts performed at a slow-moderate intensity (HR ~120-130bpm), with a weekly session of interval training to spike the heart rate. Supplement this with 2 strength-based workouts (probably weights) per week.

The customer may be insulin resistant.

Our dietician’s recommendations are:
- Portion control and balanced meals to reduce calories
- Swap out calorie-dense foods for healthier options
- Increase fibre through fruit (low fructose options)
- Moderate sodium’s impact on blood pressure

The DNA report highlighted some interesting results. Firstly, that some genes maybe working against the customer in terms of weight management – especially ones that may reduce fat burning, and make the customer prone to "emotional eating".

The assessment also revealed a genetic propensity for lactose intolerance, which the customer was aware of, as well as possible taste preferences for sweet foods and a sensivity to bitter tastes.
