Metabolic syndrome conveys 2-3x the risk of diabetes and heart disease and 1.6x overall mortality risk.

Strategies for stress management include listening to podcasts, social sport, and social activities.

Meditation or other relaxation targeted therapies are also good stress management techniques.

Increasing your frequency of exercise should assist general mental health.

Try to fit in 2 longish (45-60 minute) moderate cardio sessions each week (perhaps slow jogging, swimming, or cycling). This “zone 2” exercise is ideal for promoting aerobic fitness and fat burning. You are in "zone 2" if you can still talk in short sentences (but don’t want to). It usually correlates to a heart rate around 120-130 bpm.

Resistance training is the way to boost strength and will be good for preserving muscle mass as you lose body fat.

Taking a short stroll after meals is a great way to boost your metabolic health (and lose weight).

Improving cardiorespiratory fitness can be done through focused cardio (e.g. jogging, swimming, cycling, rowing). 

A balanced diet with lots of fresh vegetables is a good start. Other rules of thumb I’d suggest is to stop “white” carbs (sugar, rice, pasta, bread, and potato), don’t drink calories (be mindful of calories in protein shakes), and don’t eat high-fructose foods (including certain fruits such as grapes).
